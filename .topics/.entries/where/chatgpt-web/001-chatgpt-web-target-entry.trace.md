# ChatGPT Web

## Entry Identity

- Name: ChatGPT Web
- Version: 1
- Canonical Identifier: tiinex.interop.openai.entry.target.chatgpt-web.v1
- Entry Family: tiinex.target-entry.openai.v1
- Human Label: ChatGPT Web

## Purpose And Scope

- Purpose: Augment a qualified purpose Entry with ChatGPT Web environment knowledge, capability declarations, limitations, continuity guidance and host-specific source discipline.
- In Scope: ChatGPT Web host adaptation, conversation continuity constraints, attachment/package transport, qualified host capability knowledge, OpenAI-specific process references
- Out Of Scope: granting Role authority, selecting work, creating Handoff routing, making a Process applicable merely by reference, authorizing remote mutation, or redefining portable Entry semantics

## Entry Context

- Entry Target: ChatGPT Web execution environment
- Required Context: the separately selected qualified purpose Entry plus any authority-bearing Handoff/Role/Task material required by that bounded activity
- Relevant Context: ChatGPT-specific capability/limitation material and qualified OpenAI host process guidance
- Context Exclusions: chat chronology, attachment presence, model/provider identity, or UI state do not become semantic authority merely because this target is selected

## Entry Method

- Method: qualify this target and its declared Target Material, combine its environment constraints with the separately selected purpose Entry, preserve authority from the controlling Handoff/Role/Task surfaces, and expose host-specific capability/limitation knowledge without changing portable Entry meaning
- Readiness Boundary: the selected purpose Entry remains qualified, required authority remains independently qualified, and the target-specific material needed for the current environment has been qualified or its absence preserved explicitly
- Stop Conditions: target material conflicts with controlling authority; a required host capability is unavailable; the active host cannot be established with sufficient confidence for target-specific behavior

## Target Identity

- Target Handle: chatgpt-web
- Target Kind: interactive-web-host
- Canonical Target Identifier: openai.chatgpt.web
- Provider: OpenAI
- Host: ChatGPT Web
- Human Label: ChatGPT Web

## Target Capabilities

- Provides: conversational interaction, file upload, file attachment delivery, downloadable generated artifacts, conversation branching when exposed by the host, bounded connector/tool surfaces when available
- Limitations: conversation/context limits remain finite; host runtime storage is not durable project authority; capability availability may differ by account/session/client; live host UI state must not be inferred from package content alone

## Target Material

- ChatGPT continuity and source discipline
  - Reference: ../../../.processes/chatgpt-session-continuity/001-chatgpt-session-continuity-and-source-discipline-process.trace.md
  - Purpose: Supply the OpenAI-owned host adaptation for package-first recovery, carried-source preference, attachment delivery, runtime survivability and human interaction boundaries.
  - Label: ChatGPT Session Continuity And Source Discipline
  - Qualification Notes: Reference presence makes this material relevant to target grounding; its own applicability/execution semantics remain independently authoritative.

## Target Compatibility

- Compatibility Notes: May augment portable Session Entries such as Start, Explore and Resume when ChatGPT Web is the active execution environment; future discovery should prefer qualified capability/contract matching over hardcoded per-Entry allowlists.

## Interpretation Limits

- Does Not Establish: Handoff routing, recipient authority, Role-holder state, participant authority, Process applicability, task ownership, work transfer, remote-write permission, acceptance, completion, or permanent host durability
- Must Not Be Inferred: that every ChatGPT session exposes every declared capability; that branching or attachments are always available; that OpenAI-specific behavior belongs in Core or portable Native

## Portability Notes

- Portable Semantics: none beyond the inherited Target Entry composition contract; this artifact intentionally owns ChatGPT Web-specific environment meaning
- Environment Assumptions: an active ChatGPT Web session whose relevant host capabilities can be observed or qualified
- Non-Portable Details: OpenAI/ChatGPT product behavior, conversation branching, attachment/download affordances, connector/tool availability, and host runtime survivability
